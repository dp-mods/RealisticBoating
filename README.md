# [WIP] Work In Progress

It's advised you don't download this script yet if you don't know  what you're doing. As it's a WIP - it may contain bugs and some features may not be fully functioning or implemented yet.

I still need to optmize the code structure and move some functions to server side and define some variables to the local scope and not in their current form - so good things come to those who wait! I simply just made this available for anyone interested in contributing until it becomes a full release


# RealisticBoating
[WIP] A script aimed at overhauling boating mechanics in FiveM to be more feature rich and realistic. This is an ongoing Work In Progess [WIP] and any contribution is greatly appreciated!

I'm trying to keep much of this as standalone as possible. Therefore any third party framework will be optional via the config file in attempt to make things a little easier for users.
