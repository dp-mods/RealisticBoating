# RealisticBoating
[WIP] A script aimed at overhauling boating mechanics in FiveM to be more feature rich and realistic. This is an ongoing Work In Progess [WIP] and any contribution is greatly appreciated!

I'm trying to keep much of this as standalone as possible. Therefore any third party framework will be optional via the config file in attempt to make things a little easier for users.

# Work In Progress Features

- Move certain functions to server side
- Distress system
- Hypothermia
- Water based activites and jobs
